As it is show, the new vehicles (orange bars) the MPG is larger than the 

Furthermore, in order to review and to compare the performance of each fleet (current and new vehicles), using bootstrapping two confidence intervals were calculated for the standard deviation. Both confidence intervals are shown bellow:

## Histogram and Scaterplot

A business is looking at changing their current vehicle fleet and replacing their vehicles with ones used by their competitors. They are have captured the MPG of some of the cars in both fleets fleets.
